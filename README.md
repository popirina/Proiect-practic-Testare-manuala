# 1 Testing section
## 1.1 Test planning
##### The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the New Customer module from the Guru99 Bank application.
##### The plan identifies the items to be tested,the features to be tested,the types of testing to be performed,the personnel responsible for testing,the resources and schedule required to complete testing,and the risks associated with the plan.
### 1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated
#####  Project manager: Vlad Corcodel
#####  Product owner:Cosmin Pop
#####  Software developer:Gabriela Radulescu
#####  QA Engineer:Irina Pop
### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined
##### functional specifications are defined 
##### roles needed for the project are allocated 
##### initial project risks were detected and mitigated
### 1.1.3 Exit citeria defined
##### all tests have been executed 
##### all resolved bugs have been re-tested and approved by the QA team
##### deadline was reached
##### no detected major risk remained un-mitigated
##### exploratory regression testing must be performed on the New Customer module 
### 1.1.4 Test scope 
##### Tests in scope:All the featured of New Customer module which were defined in software requirement specs need to be tested.
##### Tests not in scope:performance testing,integrations of the new customer module with other modules,compatibility testing with multiple browsers
### 1.1.5 Risks detected 
##### Project risks: lack of experience of the QA team, insufficient people in the team, lack of time,
##### Product risks: validation constraints on the fields might be too restrictive to the end-user, lack of users, many competitors,
### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria
##### The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.
## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control
##### Variou periodic reports were generated to reflect the current status of the testing process, in case of major problems control measures could be taken. The following status report was generated after 50% of the test cases were executed, on 1st of June 2023

## 1.3 Test Analysis
##### The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the New customer module. The following test conditions were found:
##### Enter data only for mandatory fields and check that the new customer is created
##### Enter data for all available fields and check that the new customer is created
##### Leave mandatory fields empty and check that the new customer cannot be created
##### View new customer details and check they are correct
##### Check all validation constraints for the fields 
## 1.4 Test Design
##### Functional test cases were created in ZEPHYR SQUAD. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, and use case testing.
